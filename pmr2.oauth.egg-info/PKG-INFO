Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This module provides basic OAuth support for Zope/Plone, yet aims to be
        extensible through the Zope Component Architecture such that more
        demanding features can be slotted in.  Basic features will be provided,
        such as simple management of consumers and their keys, and local users
        will be able to approve consumer requests and revoke the keys later.
        
        For further usage information, please refer to the tests and the
        associated README files.
